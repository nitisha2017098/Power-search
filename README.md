## How search works

2. Describe how the order of results on a page is determined.
3. Learn some of the factors that go into determining a page's rank order.

```
1. When you do a google search you are not actually searching the web
you are searching google's index of the web or at least as much of it we can find.
2. We do this with software programs called "spiders"

3. Spiders start by fetching a few web pages then they follow the links on those 
web pages and fetch the pages they point to and follow all the links on those web 
pages and fetch the pages they link to and so on until we have indexed a preety 
big chunk of the web, many billions of pages stored across thousands of machines.

```

**NOTE**
+ Google looks for the word you typed in, but sometimes also looks for synonyms or 
related terms. Any words appearing in boldface type in your search results are 
terms Google associates with your search terms. For example, if you search for 
[kittens] you might see the word cats in boldface in your results.
+ Ads appear in response to some queries and are always labeled ads.
+ Aside from ads, website owners cannot pay to influence the placement of their 
website in the search results.
